# scalax-ensime

Slides for Scala eXchange 2015 "The atomic sublimity of Ensime".

To generate the talk, install [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and run `./.scalax-ensime.org.pandoc`. Note that pandoc 1.15.x is required, which at the time of writing is not available in Debian (`cabal update ; cabal install pandoc`).
