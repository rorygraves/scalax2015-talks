* The coming storm!

** Enjime - Aemon

- Ensime supporting Java
- In beta

** Graphpocolypse! - Sam

- Cross reference data in a graph DB.
- A feature enable
  - Find usage
  - code analysis
- Don't interrupt Sam

** Improved debugging support - Robin/Chip

- Our debugging support 'sort of works'
- Looking to integrate https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/scala-debugger-api
- Should give us huge boosts to breakpoints/stepping etc.

** Compiler support - Rory

- Abstract the presentation compiler interaction.
- Unpicking compiler dependencies so we can support Dotty
- Current we use a lot of internal Apis.

** More editor support - Everybody

- Editors are not at feature parity
- They are evolving as we speak.


* Conclusions


** Conclusion

- Ensime continues to evolving

- Its exciting times

- Come join the party!

** Hack Day!

- ScalaXHack!
- CodeNode, Underscore, London Scala User Group
- Come hack on cool open source stuff
